      <h2>Everything About The <i>Pheonix</i></h2>
      <p>A pheonix in ancient stories, is a mythical bird believed to be able to live for 500 years. Every half of a <i>eon</i> it would set itself ablaze and experience <b>Nirvana</b>, where if it succeeded the pheonix would be reborn from its ashes, become stroner, and have its life cycle set back to 0.</p> 
      <p>The bird is believed to have had the power to breath hell fire, super speed, flight, shapeshifting, spontaneous combustion.</p>

    <p>The Phoenix was known to be one of the most beautiful and perfect creatures by those who recognized it – likely because the creature was associated with Paradise where all things are perfect. Most accounts of the Phoenix describe it as being red and yellow in coloration, though there are many variations. All that is known is that the appearance of the mighty bird was unlike any other and that it stood out because of is feathers.</p>
    <p>There are also several variations on the eyes of the creature. Some sources claim that the eyes of the Phoenix are a brilliant shade of yellow, while others claim that they are like two shining sapphires.</p>
    <p>All accounts of the bird emphasize the size of the creature, leading some to wonder if the Phoenix could have been inspired by a species of giant bird.</p>
